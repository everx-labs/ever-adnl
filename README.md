## About

Implementation of Abstract Datagram Network Layer (ADNL) protocol stack in safe Rust. ADNL is a protocol layer that provides all low level communications between Everscale/Venom blockshain nodes. Depending on scenario, ADNL can operate on top of UDP or TCP protocols. 

Stack implementation includes several other protocols accompanying ADNL in node operation. Specifically:
- Reliable Large Datagram Protocol (RLDP). RLDP is a protocol that runs on top of ADNL UDP, which is used to transfer large data blocks and includes Forward Error Correction (FEC) algorithms as a replacement of acknowledgment packets on the other side. This makes it possible to transfer data between network components more efficiently, but with more traffic consumption.
- Overlay protocol. This protocol runs on top of ADNL UDP, and it is responsible for dividing a single network into additional subnetworks (overlays). Overlays can be both public, to which anyone can connect, and private, where additional credentials is needed for entry, known only to a certain amount of participants.
- Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Protocol. DHT protocol essentially manages the distributed key-value database, where each member of the network can store something, for example, information about themselves.
